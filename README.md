## Description

This project is a console-driven "life expectancy calculator" and conversion tool. The assignment's criteria included the conversion an individual's age to the equivalent number of years in "Mercury," "Venus," "Mars," and "Jupiter" reckoning. I thought it would be fun to write a general-purpose "measurement conversion" tool that could be used for any supported units, whether they be Earth-years, Mars-years, minutes, seconds, or complex measurements like rates of speed.
